	% first index indicates different Fourier harmonics, first (no) correspond
	% to the TE polarization; second (no) correspond to the TM polarization
	% second index indicates wether the amplitudes are in the substrate (1) in the superstrate (2)
V_inc(1*no+ind0,2) = 1; % "TM" polarized plane wave (0-th harmonic) incoming from the superstrate

%% scattering matrix calculation

	% for a lamellar grating with filling factor 0.4

	% scattering matrix of the grating

%% diffraction of a plane wave example
V_sca = zeros(2*no,2); % allocate a vector of diffracted field amplitudes
	% apply the calculated scattering matrix to the incident vector:
V_sca(:,1) = SM(:,:,1,1)*V_inc(:,1) + SM(:,:,1,2)*V_inc(:,2); % diffraction to the substrate
V_sca(:,2) = SM(:,:,2,1)*V_inc(:,1) + SM(:,:,2,2)*V_inc(:,2); % diffraction to the superstrate
  % check the power conservation
b = fmmnc_balance(no,V_inc,V_sca,kx0,ky0,kg,eps_sub,eps_sup);
disp(b); % precicision of the power conservation
	% calculate the vector of diffraction efficiencies:

disp(V_eff(0*no+ind0,1)); % zero order power transmission to TE
