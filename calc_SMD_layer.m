%% description:
% calculate a diagonal S-matrix of a homogeneous layer for a 1D set of
% wavevector projections
%% input:
% no: number of Fourier harmonics
% kx0: zero harmonic wavevector projection
% kg: wavevector step
% kh: layer thickness multiplied by the vacuum wavenumber
% eps: layer permittivity
%% output:
% SMD: diagonal interface S-matrix of size (no,2,2)
% block SMD(:,1,1) corresponds to refelection from below to below
% block SMD(:,2,2) corresponds to refelection from above to above
% block SMD(:,2,1) corresponds to transmission from below to above
% block SMD(:,1,2) corresponds to transmission from above to below
% central harmonic index is ind_0 = ceil(no/2)
%% implementation:
function [SMD] = calc_SMD_layer(no, kx0, kg, kh, eps)
	kz = fmm_kxz(no, kx0, 0, kg, eps, eps);
	SMD = zeros(no,2,2);
	SMD(:,1,2) = exp((1i*kh)*kz);
	SMD(:,2,1) = SMD(:,1,2);
end
