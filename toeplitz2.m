%% description:
% return a 2D Toeplitz matrix (2D analog of the matlab function 'toeplitz')
%% input:
% M: vector of size (2*ny-1)*(2*nx-1)
% nx, ny: block dimensions of Toeplitz matrix
%% output:
% T: 2D block-Toeplitz matrix of size nx*ny
%% implementation:
function [T] = toeplitz2(M, nx, ny)
	CT = cell(1,2*nx-1);
	ind = toeplitz(linspace(nx,2*nx-1,nx),flip(linspace(1,nx,nx)));		
	for i = 1:2*nx-1
		CT{1,i} = toeplitz(M(ny:2*ny-1,i),M(ny:-1:1,i));
	end
	T = cell2mat(CT(ind));
end
